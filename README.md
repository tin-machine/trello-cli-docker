# trello-cli-docker

trello is a nice tool, but on rare occasions I want to use it from the command line.
I looked around and found trello-cli ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/trello-cli ) as a nice command line tool.

I created a Dockerfile to make it even easier to set up.

If you want to use it on Windows or macOS, you can use https://www.npmjs.com/package/trello-cli

If you want to use it with docker-compose, you can use Please refer to docker-compose.yml in this folder.
